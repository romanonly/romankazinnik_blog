Notebook with 98% AUC. The pipeline and components are based on [TaxiTips Tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/docs/tutorials/tfx/components_keras.ipynb). The custom features are based on [Kaggle Example](https://www.kaggle.com/imoore/titanic-the-only-notebook-you-need-to-see/notebook).
## Setting Up

1. Install Anaconda
2. Create and activate a new environment:

    conda activate titanic
    ```

3. Install Tensorflow and TFX

    ```
    conda install tensorflow
